		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hi, I'm Justin and I'm currently studying computer science with a focus on machine learning and deep
			learning at the University of Washington! In the future, I hope to contribute to state of the
			art research as a graduate student, and I am planning to undertake undergraduate research to
			help achieve that goal. I also love to play violin and am currently playing in the University of
			Washington Symphony Orchestra! Below is one of my favorite performances to have performed. I am
			also an enjoyer of anime and esports titles like Valorant (only ValorantðŸ˜¢). My favorite anime
			is a film titled <i>Look Back</i> and my peak rank is Diamond 1 (ðŸ˜¢).</p>

		<h2>Publications</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong><a href=https://doi.org/10.47611/jsrhs.v11i3.3597>Machine Learning for Policy
						Guidance</a></strong><br>
				<em>Journal for Student Research, August 2022</em><br>
				Research article that I published in high school about using feature analysis of an
				accurate machine learning model. The model predicted an index score of how well off
				people in a country were. To see which features best predicted the score, they were
				removed to see how much the accuracy dropped, indicating high importance to the model.

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Using convolutional neural networks for 3D species distribution modeling of
					Southern Ocean phytoplankton</strong><br>
				<b>Abstract: </b>The Southern Ocean is a large component of the global
				carbon cycle, and phytoplankton play a key role by converting CO2 to organic carbon,
				which can be transported to the
				deep ocean. Current studies examine phytoplankton presence and CO2 flux but do not take
				community species composition into account. In the past, we have explored training
				a classical machine learning model to predict species distributions. Now we aim to model
				phytoplankton community
				composition in the Southern Ocean using deep learning.

		<h2>Achievements</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Leo Maddox Foundation Endowed Scholarship (2024)</strong><br>
				I received the Leo Maddox Foundation Endowed Scholarship, made to honor Leo Maddox
				Schneider of Seattle, an aspiring computer scientist, oceanographer, and athlete who
				passed away at age 13 from complications stemming from severe injuries he sustained in
				an automobile accident.
