		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hi, I'm Justin and I'm currently studying computer science with a focus on machine learning and deep
			learning at the University of Washington! In the future, I hope to contribute to state of the
			art research as a graduate student, and I am planning to undertake undergraduate research to
			help achieve that goal. I also love to play violin and am currently playing in the University of
			Washington Symphony Orchestra! Below is one of my favorite performances to have performed. I am
			also an enjoyer of anime and esports titles like Valorant (only ValorantðŸ˜¢). My favorite anime
			is a film titled <i>Look Back</i> and my peak rank is Diamond 1 (ðŸ˜¢).</p>

				<strong><a href=https://doi.org/10.47611/jsrhs.v11i3.3597>Machine Learning for Policy
						Guidance</a></strong><br>
				<em>Journal for Student Research, August 2022</em><br>
				Research article that I published in high school about using feature analysis of an
				accurate machine learning model. The model predicted an index score of how well off
				people in a country were. To see which features best predicted the score, they were
				removed to see how much the accuracy dropped, indicating high importance to the model.
