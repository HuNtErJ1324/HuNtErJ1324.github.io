			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Hi, I'm Justin and I'm currently studying computer science and mathematics with a focus on artificial
				intelligence and
				machine learning at the University of Washington! I hope to contribute to the state of the art in these
				fields
				through research! I also love to play violin and am currently playing in the University of
				Washington Symphony Orchestra! I am an enjoyer of anime and video games. My favorite anime
				work is a film titled <i>Chainsawman Movie: Reze Arc</i> and my current favorite game is <i>Helldivers 2</i>.

					<strong><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27072>Towards Understanding Self-play for LLM Reasoning</a></strong><br>
					<em>The 5th Workshop on Mathematical Reasoning and AI at NeurIPS 2025</em><br>
					<b>Abstract:</b> Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning, 
					led by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), have inspired 
					self-play post-training, where models improve by generating and solving their 
					own problems. While self-play has shown strong in-domain and out-of-domain gains, 
					the mechanisms behind these improvements remain poorly understood. In this work, 
					we analyze the training dynamics of self-play through the lens of the Absolute Zero Reasoner, 
					comparing it against RLVR and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our study examines parameter update sparsity, 
					entropy dynamics of token distributions, and alternative proposer reward functions. We further connect 
					these dynamics to reasoning performance using pass@k evaluations. Together, our findings clarify how 
					self-play differs from other post-training strategies, highlight its inherent limitations, and point 
					toward future directions for improving LLM math reasoning through self-play.

					<strong><a href=https://doi.org/10.47611/jsrhs.v11i3.3597>Machine Learning for Policy
							Guidance</a></strong><br>
					<em>Journal for Student Research, August 2022</em><br>
					<b>Abstract:</b> This paper leverages machine learning algorithms and techniques to create models
					that can assist in a country's policy guidance. The machine learning process used to conduct
					research is discussed with steps such as preprocessing, feature selection, model selection, and
					model interpretation. Specifically, using datasets from the CIA's World Factbook and the United
					Nations' Human Development Index (HDI), machine learning models are created that use select features
					from several counties (e.g., real gross domestic product (GDP), population, and area). Then, the
					models make predictions on the countries' HDI scores. Model interpretation methods are used to find
					the most important features in predicting a country's score. This paper argues that important
					features can be derived through machine learning and guide government policy relevant to human
					development. Supply-side policies are discussed based on the results from the machine learning
					models. The use of machine learning with other indexes is also explored.

					<strong>Using convolutional neural networks for 3D species distribution modeling of
						Southern Ocean phytoplankton (2024 for CSE 493G)
					</strong><br>
					<b>Abstract: </b>The Southern Ocean is a large component of the global
					carbon cycle, and phytoplankton play a key role by converting CO2 to organic carbon,
					which can be transported to the
					deep ocean. Current studies examine phytoplankton presence and CO2 flux but do not take
					community species composition into account. In the past, we have explored training
					a classical machine learning model to predict species distributions. Now we aim to model
					phytoplankton community
					composition in the Southern Ocean using deep learning.

			<h2>Achievements</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Leo Maddox Foundation Endowed Scholarship (2024)</strong><br>
					I received the Leo Maddox Foundation Endowed Scholarship, made to honor Leo Maddox
					Schneider of Seattle, an aspiring computer scientist, oceanographer, and athlete who
					passed away at age 13 from complications stemming from severe injuries he sustained in
					an automobile accident.
				</li>
				<li><strong>National Merit Boeing Scholarship (2023)</strong><br>
					The National Merit Scholarship Program is an annual academic competition among high school
					students for recognition and college undergraduate scholarships that began in 1955. The
					program is conducted by National Merit Scholarship Corporation (NMSC®), a not-for-profit
					organization that operates without government assistance. United States high school students
					enter the National Merit Scholarship Program by taking the Preliminary SAT/National Merit
					Scholarship
					Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT®), which serves as an initial screen of over 1.3 million entrants each
					year,
					and by meeting published program entry and participation requirements.
